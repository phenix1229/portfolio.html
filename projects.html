                    The following are a couple of projects using macros and VBA (my first bit of coding).

                    The first is a practice exam for ITIL certification which shows/hides the correct answers, has some formatting for correct answers, scores the exam in real-time, and clears all answers for another try. I created this for a class I took based off the spreadsheet they had which only contained the exam questions.

                <p style="padding-inline: 30px">
                    The second is an expense tracker I made for a friend whose checking account was constantly getting overdrawn. I created a button and a dropdown menu for their most common expenses, added a button for miscellaneous expenses, and a button and dropdown menu for deposits. The first sheet contains the menu items and starting balance which is carried over to the next sheet and is updated with each new expense or deposit. There is also a feature that automatically opens a new sheet with the date on it every time it is opened on a new day. This was created from scratch.
